# spirograph-ios
Simple spirograph simulation made as an IOS app for a fourth-year special topics course.


# Building
```
Built using Xcode and Swift 4. Tested using the iPhone 8 simulator on Xcode.
```


# Usage
```
The .txt file labelled 'input.txt' contains the parameters to describe the shape of the spirograph. Please follow the exact format already used in the file - the parser will likely fail on most half-complex test cases.

Once input.txt is setup with your parameters, run the program!
